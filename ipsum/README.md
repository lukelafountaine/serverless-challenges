## Build a Serverless Ipsum generator.

Build a simple serverless-backed web app that displays Serverless Ipsum when it is loaded. Or Tony Danza Ipsum. Or The Office Ipsum. Or Reasons-I-Can’t-Take-Out-The-Trash Ipsum.

As long as it looks like Lorem Ipsum, but uses different words, we’re good. The page doesn’t have to look fancy, and you can do this even if you’ve never coded anything in your life!
